### Concept: Wisdom of the Crowd

This project demonstrates how a group's collective judgment can be more accurate than individual opinions, especially when extreme outliers are removed.
By trimming the data, the average (mean) and middle value (median) of the groupâ€™s estimates tend to align closely with a true or expected value, showcasing the power of the **Wisdom of the Crowd**.
**Outlier Removal:**
   - To demonstrate the accuracy of the collective opinion, the program removes **the lowest 10% and the highest 10%** of the estimates.
**Data Visualization:**
   - The program then generates a plot to show the estimates after outlier removal:
     - A **red dashed line** representing the filtered estimates.
     - Three key statistical markers are highlighted:
       - **Mean (red circle)**: The average estimate of the remaining data after outlier removal.
       - **Median (blue square)**: The middle value in the sorted estimates.
       - **Fixed Estimate (green triangle)**: A predetermined reference value (375) is plotted for comparison.
 **Key Insight:**
   - The plot demonstrates that, even if individual estimates vary significantly, the *mean and median* of the group's estimates converge toward a more accurate value after eliminating extreme outliers.
